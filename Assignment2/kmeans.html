            <!-- Description -->
            The map in this exercise visualizes the output of the Kmeans clustering algorithm from week 5.
            <br /> 
            The results for K = 2, ... , 6 has been created and can be toggled between using the buttons below.
            <br />
            All crimes has been mapped out and each crime is given a color corresponding to the cluster it is assigned to.
            <br />
            Cluster centroids has also been added and is depicted as larger circles with a black outline. 
            <br />
            <br />
            The iPython notebook used to generate the data is linked to in the GitHub repo. 
            <br />
            <br />
            The data consists of 16162 crimes in the prostitution category. Each entry consists of a lat/lng pair plus an index for each value of K depicting the cluster label
            <br />
            Our file has been reduced to 850kb in size which is acceptable. Keeping small file sizes are important as the client/viewer
            <br />
            has to download all resources to view the visualization. Larger files might, in the worst case, make the browser run out of memory when doing operations
